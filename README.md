# 𝓕𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓴𝔂𝓯𝓲𝓮𝓻 𝟐.𝟎  
A fresh and improved version of the classic 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓴𝔂𝓯𝓲𝓮𝓻! Now with a way better design, making it easier to use—especially if pressing a single button felt like rocket science before.  

## What is Freakyfier 2.0?  
At its core, it’s still the same tool that lets you turn boring text into 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓴𝔂 Unicode mode. But this time, it’s actually fun to use. The UI is cleaner, everything runs smoother, and—most importantly—it’s not a buggy mess anymore.  

## Why use it?  

- **Instant Text Freakification** – Type normally, get fancy 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓴𝔂 text instantly.  
- **Works Everywhere** – Hook it to your keyboard and use it in any app that supports extended Unicode.  
- **Sleek UI** – Looks better, feels better, no more *“what does this button even do?”* moments.  
- **Fast & Lightweight** – Now even *less* optimized, having increased memory usage from **3MB to a whopping 14MB** during runtime. *Shame on me!*
